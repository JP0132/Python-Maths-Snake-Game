# Snake Game with Mathematics made with Python  

## This was my A-Level project, to create a snake game in Python that allowed the user to answer math questions whilst playing. The user can view their high scores, and look at which the number of times they got a question right or wrong.  

* Python was used to code the game.  
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using Tkinter.  
* Tkinter is used to create the game windows, buttons and the snake shapes created by drawing squares.  
* Game was created in object oriented programming. My first full scale project created with this principle.  
* Kept different versions during the development stage, to keep track of the progress, allow easier write up.
* Python pickle files was used to keep track of the scores and answers.  
* In the report I have done different research to ensure I have the best idea on what features the game should have.  
  *   Obeservation of the client in their current system.  
  *   Interviews of the client and his parents.  
  *   Questionaries to get a further idea.  
  *   Analysis of existing solutions.  

## How it works and looks

### Question window  
*The recording would not record any pop-up windows, as such here is a screen shot.*

## How to run  

### Prerequisites  
* Computer with Python installed.  

### Running it.  
1. Clone the project or download the files.  
   * Ensure you download the Annotated -  Final Version.py and arrowkeys.gif files if you take this route.  
2. To run the project, you can use your prefer code editor, and you should be able to run it.  

#### 3 Ways how I ran the project.  
1. Use the default python code editor.  
  * Open the file in the default Python interperter.  
  * Press F5 to run it or from the tool bar at the top.  
2. Use Visual Studio Code.    
  * Install the extension code runner.  
  * Once installed, run the project, you should be asked to select which Python you want to use that is install on your computer.  
3. From the command line terminal.  
  * Add python to your system variable.  
  * Open the file directory in your cmd.  
  * Easy way to do this in **Windows**: Open it in the file explorer and type cmd in the address bar.  
  * Now in the cmd terminal, type: *python "Annotated - Final Version.py"*  
    * You can use this to run any python file/script from the cmd.
